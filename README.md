### Deciding on technical and architectural choices
#### ExpressJs
 It is lightweight backend framework that creates a simple server Instantly and gets you started head on.
#### Heroku
  Heroku is a free, has lots of third party libraries those can be handy for implementing functionalities those are
  already built thus costing you less time to set up your deployment.

### Improvements those could be made
  Could have used Redux to reduce the complexity of state management and to follow proper design patterns introduced in
  ReactJS.

### If more time was allocated
- I would have created a simple passwordless website where user suggestions could have been made more useful. 
- The other thing I wanted to add was to show uniqueness of the website name that helps the website for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) purposes.
