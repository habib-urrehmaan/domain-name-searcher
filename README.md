Deciding on technical and architectural choices
For deciding on technical and architectural choices;
Choosing ExpressJs:
ExpressJs is lightweight backend framework that creates a simple server Instantly and gets you started head on.
Choosing Heroku:
Heroku is a free, has lots of third party libraries those can be handy for implementing functionalities those are
already built thus costing you less time to set up your deployment.

Improvements those could be made
I could have used Redux to reduce the complexity of state management and to follow proper design patterns introduced in
ReactJS.

What would have done if allocated more time
I would have created a simple passwordless website where user suggestions could have been made more useful. 
I might have used a different third party api to deliver the recommendations that would have been better for the user. 
The other thing I wanted to add was to show uniqueness of the website name that helps the website for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) purposes.
